I have implemented routes and model Schemas as an assignmnet for MERN Stack course. Backend only
Admin Routes ar implemented by my Tutor you can  find his code at @TEKMODE.
•	First, I added two new schema models, one named “Assignment” and second named “Announcements”.
•	Assignment is used to add assignment by teacher using POST method, students can only view this assignment by GET method.
•	Announcements are used to add general announcements by head using POST method, students and teachers can only view these announcements by GET method.
•	I implemented 4 GET and 1 POST route for teacher.
•	I implemented 3 GET routes for student.
•	I implemented 1 GET and 1 POST route for head.
